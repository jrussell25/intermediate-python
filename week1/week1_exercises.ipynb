Such a matrix is called an [Adjacency matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix) and has many very useful properties in the mathematical analysis of networks. *Note* Let's not include actors appearing in movies \"with themselves.\" In other words, the diagonal elements of this matrix should all be zeros."
